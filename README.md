## Overview
This project is a landing page for an Event Planner app, built as part of the IBM Full Stack Software Developer course on Coursera. The purpose of the app is to showcase a service that plans both personal and corporate events. This landing page includes key sections such as the app description, event categories, main features, customer testimonials, a contact form, and a footer.

The focus of this project was to implement a well-structured React component using JSX syntax, and to practice building reusable and modular components in React.

## Project Features
- **App Description:** Introduction to the Event Planner application.
- **Event Categories:** Display of the different types of events that the organization plans (e.g., weddings, conferences, parties, etc.).
- **Features:** List of key features the app offers, such as booking management, budgeting tools, etc.
- **Testimonials:** Display of customer reviews fetched from a dynamic data source.
- **Contact Form:** A form to collect user inquiries or event booking requests.
- **Footer:** Contains links to relevant sections and additional information about the organization.

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, the following skills and concepts were developed:

- **Component-based Architecture:** Structuring the landing page using reusable components for a clean, organized, and maintainable codebase.
- **JSX Syntax:** Writing UI elements such as headers, paragraphs, lists, and buttons using JSX within React functional components.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering:** Dynamically displaying event categories, features, and testimonials fetched from data sources.
- **Semantic HTML Markup:** Ensuring usability and SEO benefits by using semantic HTML elements like <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.
